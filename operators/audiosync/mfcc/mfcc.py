def mfcc(input, nwin=256, nfft=512, fs=16000, nceps=13):
    """Compute Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients.

    Parameters
    ----------
    input: ndarray
        input from which the coefficients are computed

    Returns
    -------
    ceps: ndarray
        Mel-cepstrum coefficients
    mspec: ndarray
        Log-spectrum in the mel-domain.

    Notes
    -----
    MFCC are computed as follows:
        * Pre-processing in time-domain (pre-emphasizing)
        * Compute the spectrum amplitude by windowing with a Hamming window
        * Filter the signal in the spectral domain with a triangular
        filter-bank, whose filters are approximatively linearly spaced on the
        mel scale, and have equal bandwidth in the mel scale
        * Compute the DCT of the log-spectrum
