    """*brief* Align two audio strips


    Tries to synchronize the selected audio strip to the active audio strip by comparing the sound.
    Useful to synchronize audio of the same event recorded with different microphones.

    To use this feature, you must have [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html) and
    [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/install.html) installed on your computer and available on the PATH (command line) to work.

    The longer the audio files, the longer the tool can take to run, as it has to convert, analyze,
    and compare the audio sources to work.
